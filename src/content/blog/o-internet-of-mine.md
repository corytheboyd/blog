It's really hard to write stuff and publish it. Not hard to do, but...

I cannot turn off that little voice that tells me I have nothing new to say, that I have no new perspectives to animate with douchey faux thought leadership drivel. I have no cute headlines to bait links with, nor the wherewithall to stoop to that level of completely bankrupt crap craftery.

None-the-fucking-less, other people keep forcing their shit out directly into the fan. It's... embarrasing. I don't get how people go to lunch on Monday with Hank, when we ALLLLL saw the abosolute flaming dumpster of a post he made on LinedIn about "returning to office is GOOD for autonomy." Shut the FUCK up, Hank.  

So anyway. Fuck it. What MORE harm can I possibly do by shitting my own awful trash into the internet. Maybe MY shit will become THE shit... hahahahaha. Maybe my shit will like, land on top of some other shit and loosten it up, making it easier to scrape it all off later.

So now you know, this is what I feel like adding Content to the Internet. Yet another defacation sprinkler, blasting fecal matter onto the wall.

This is what you deserve. This is what I deserve. 

Let us synchronize our depressions into a fucked up double helix of shareholder value, rocketing toward the sun. If we're lucky, we'll burn up and die sans drama, otherwise, I guess we'll pick up our bootstraps some more and try harder next fiscal year.

Are we having fun yet?!
